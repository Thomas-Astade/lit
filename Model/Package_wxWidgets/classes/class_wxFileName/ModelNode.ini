Description=wxFileName encapsulates a file name. This class serves two purposes: first, it provides the functions to split the file names into components and to recombine these components in the full file name which can then be passed to the OS file functions (and wxWidgets functions wrapping them). Second, it includes the functions for working with the files itself. Note that to change the file data you should use wxFile class instead. wxFileName provides functions for working with the file attributes.
